# Enhance-Data-Security-Utilizing-DNA-Cryptography-Salsa20-Algorithm-and-IPFS

The primary objective of this project is to create a Python Tkinter desktop application that features a user-friendly graphical interface. The application will incorporate a two-step encryption process: firstly, the encryption key will be encrypted using DNA encryption. Secondly, the encrypted key will be used to encrypt text using Salsa20 encryption. The resulting file will be securely stored in the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). To facilitate decryption, users will be able to input the IPFS hash to retrieve the file and the encryption key to decrypt it. The decrypted content will be displayed within the graphical user interface. Furthermore, an evaluation will be carried out to compare the efficiency and speed of the proposed DNA-based Salsa20 encryption approach with the existing DNA-based AES encryption method.
